  __*Study Up*__ is an online flashcard studying app. Whether you are on the go and forgot your notebook and notes for class at home, or just trying to teach your little ones the difference between a cat and a dog, *Study Up* is for you!
  
  Our App gives the user the ability to create fully customizable note cards. You can add titles and descriptions to decks of cards and then terms and definitions to the note cards. We integrated __*Twinword Dictionary API*__ that can be turned on or off to help with spelling along with populating definitions for accurate convenience. Along with that we added features to share with other users to Study together. So be smart and __*Study Up*__ today!


## Features

* Create a fully customizable __*Study Up*__ `Deck` with a `title` and a `description` of anything you want.
* Next add a `Card` with the specific `term` and `definition` of the term.
* You can add as many `Cards` as you need to your specific `Deck`.
* You can add as many `Decks` as you need to your __*Study Up*__ account.
* Spelling for `terms` and `definitions` can be turned on to add our integrated __[Twinword Dictionary API](https://www.twinword.com/api/word-dictionary.php),__ for your convenience.
